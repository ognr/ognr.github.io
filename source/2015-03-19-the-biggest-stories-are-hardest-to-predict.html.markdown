People sometimes assume that we sensationalise news reports, or, that we have some knack for predicting what news will be popular and post those reports at just the right time.  Every news agency does that, right? We don’t.  We are pretty serious about the mandate to be objective, to avoid speculation and also to be first, fast and accurate  (See the OG.NR Editor’s Guide). We also want to disrupt the habit of traditional news editors who impose their prediction of what news will matter the most on everyone.  OG.NR should be a place where people get the news they want to see, not the news the Editor’s want them to see.  Lastly (and most obviously) we don’t actually make news – people do, we only publish it as it comes to us.  You cannot be first and fast if you save news for “just the right time.”

But that doesn’t mean that we don’t observe certain trends.  We learned the hard way that reports on the Vybz Kartel murder trial had the propensity to (and did) crash our servers the second they were posted.  And of course we watch the statistics when we post certain reports that seem exciting to us (the Real Time Visitors tab on Google Analytics can be as exciting as watching a football match).

We know, for example, that our stats are highly dependent on individual reports. One or two reports can blow away any trend that we may have observed for the week, or month.  So for February, 9 reports accounted for almost 25% of all the traffic to the site:

In fact, if you look at the stats on a graph you can see when each of the reports was posted:

**Sunday, Feb 1:** Unconfirmed: Video of boy being buried alive circulates online (3,737 views) <br />
**Sunday, Feb 1:** Confirmed: Autopsy reveals Frome tech student was pregnant (6,375 views) <br />
**Sunday Feb 8:** Confirmed: Music selector killed in a family dispute (2,675 views) <br />
**Friday, Feb 13:** Confirmed: Alleged eyewitness disputes account of UWI attack (3,945 views) <br />
**Tuesday, Feb 17:** Confirmed: Man shot dead for wining on woman (2,450 views) <br />

Then of course, there is that humongous spike on the 21st that completely shocked us.  First, it was on a Sunday, which is usually a “slow day.”  Secondly, it is a huge spike, with 100-200% more traffic than other days in the month. 

In fact, the statistics for that day reveals spikes for 3 related reports (updates to a previous report):

**Confirmed:** Woman collapses and dies at corporate 5k run (8,772 views) <br />
**Confirmed:** Victim who died at 5k identified (3,267 views) <br />
**Confirmed:** 5k Victim’s family insured in crash (4,353 views) <br />


These together accounted for over 50% of the traffic on the day, and the largest spike was one report that accounted for 35% of the traffic for that day:

So in February we made some interesting observations:

1. **Users enjoy updates:**  One report that attracts a lot of attention is good, but users love updates to reports.  For OG.NR, reports are information on a news event published quickly.  So unlike traditional news media that “await further details,” OG.NR is able to publish information in reports as it becomes available.  Thus, whole stories will unfold from a first report through all the updates to it.  Users love this because they get more information, and they get it quickly. Of the top 10 reports for February, 50% were an update (or a report that was updated on the same day).  The day with the most traffic, February 21, had three related reports that spiked up traffic tremendously.
2. **It is best to let news be news:** We can always watch for trends, but it is way more exciting to watch life as it unfolds and be the vector for communicating life as it truly is.  News that excites users can happen on any day of the week (even Sundays) and users are capable of figuring out what they are interested in without Editors forcing it on them.  Months like these validate our theory that all we have to do is work to provide “all the world’s news” and in doing so, we will grow.
3. **OG.NR works:** The death of the woman at one of the largest running events in Jamaica was a “major news item” in Jamaica, and OG.NR was the first to break the news. And OG.NR was the first to provide updates on the initial report.  OG.NR beat the mainstream dailies- the Jamaica Observer and the Jamaica Gleaner- who were official sponsors with full-time reporters covering the event live:
