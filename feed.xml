    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;People often ask "What is &lt;a href="http://og.nr"&gt;OG.NR&lt;/a&gt;?"  We think this is a great question to get, especially when people add, "We know you have fast, breaking news, but what are you really?"  In the past we toyed around with words like "website" or "platform" or even "community." These are all great but now we focus less on what we are "are" and more on what we "do."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do breaking news.  We do not merely provide content (like other online news agencies that simply replicate the newspaper model online). We do fast, accurate breaking news. We bring people together so that they can share the news that matters to them, have it verified and validated by editors and the community, and empower people to confidently share their experiences with the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://og.nr"&gt;OG.NR&lt;/a&gt; is working to disrupt the news industry by making news faster, more social, and more accurate.  The analogy we like to use is the campfire, where everyone comes together to share what they saw and heard and have it validated by others who were there. If the whole world could gather around our campfire, we would have all the world's news.  The possibilities are endless. There is nowhere else on the internet like it. What we do is special, and we want to share that with the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this new blog is our opportunity to share our journey with you.  We have been working for the past four years far outside of the spotlight to keep attention on the product. Now, we want to share insights and lessons we are learning along the way.  We learn something new everyday.  It might also be useful if people understood some of the decision-making processes that go into creating something this disruptive.  This will be the channel for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for joining us on this journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are the News.&lt;/p&gt;
